          "content": "Biography . I received my PhD on talking-face biometric authentication from Telecom ParisTech (France) in 2007. . In 2008, I joined Dublin City University (Ireland) to work on video summarization techniques applied to user-generated content. . I have been a permanent CNRS researcher since 2008: . at IRIT (Toulouse, France) in the SAMoVA group until 2010 | at LIMSI (Orsay, France) in the Spoken Language Processing group until 2020 | back at IRIT (Toulouse, France) until today | . My current research interests include deep learning techniques applied to machine listening, with a strong focus on speaker diarization: I am proud to be known as “the guy behind pyannote“. . Since 2021, I have also started working as a self-employed scientific advisor and am available for contracting on topics related to my academic research. . Contact .
